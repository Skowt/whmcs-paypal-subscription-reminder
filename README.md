## 1. Description

PayPal Subscription Reminder is an ADDON for WHMCS which automatically creates
a ticket when a new customer cancellation is received.
It does not have the actual functionality to check if there's a valid Paypal Subscription,
but will send a reminder to ever customer that cancels.

This is in order to reduce the number of angry customers who forget to cancel their subscriptions 
and then come looking to the hosting company for answers.
